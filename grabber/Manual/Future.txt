'grabber' Manual 
--------------------
'path'			-	manages the destination directory path for the specified method purview.  Each purview must have a single destination						  directory in which the serializable data caches will be stored.  
	'/r'		-	READ flag; returns the current destination directory path for the purview.
	'/u'        -   UPDATE flag; changes the destination directory for a given purview.  Provide the new destination path as the second function			  parameter, after the purview is specified (see examples below).
	EXAMPLES	
					'path {/r} {Purview}'
					'path {/r, /u} {Purview}, {newDestinationDirectoryPath}'
--------------------			
'cache'			-	manages the cache file(s) in the destination directory. by default, this command will return the list of purviews and 
					their most current associated cache files.
    '/r'        -   REFRESH flag; refresh the entire data cache.
	'/w'		-	WRITE flag; creates a new cache file to overwrite the existing file. 
	'/f'		-	FREEZE flag; when used with '/w' (order doesn't matter), the current cache file will not be overwritten by the new cache
					file that is created.  Applications making use of the cache will read only the most recent cache file. 
	'/c'		-	COPY flag; copies the current cache file to the specified destination directory (requires additional parameter to be 
					provided). 
	'/d'		-   DELETE flag; deletes only the most current cache file in the destination folder;

	EXAMPLES 
					'cache'	
					'cache {/w /f} {methodPurview}'
					'cache {/w /f /c} {methodPurview, directoryPathforCopiedFile}'
					'cache {/d} {methodPurview}' 
-------------------		
'register'		-  register a new datafile with the External Cache Manager (ECM).  Provide Purview, filename and Serialization Object Model (SOM)
				   type.  The SOM type must be contained in a SOM class definition accessible to the grabber, and must match exactly the case 
				   and spelling of the class.
	'/q'		-  Set the database query object for a specified cache file.  This command receives multiple parameters, specifies whether a  
				   query/nonquery/storedprocedure is used, and verifies that the target file is indeed capable of receiving the data output. 

	EXAMPLES
				'register {Purview}, {fileName}, {SOMClassType}'
-------------------			
'rename'		-  rename an existing data file.  Provide the name of the targetfile, then the new name that will be used for the file. 

	EXAMPLES	
				'rename {oldFileName}, {newFileName}'
-------------------	
'restore'		-  restores to default folder and file configuration.  since this will erase/overwrite existing data, a warning message 
				   will be displayed and additional user input will be required before running the restoration process. 
	'/o'		-  OVERRIDE the default directory used as the root directory for cache folders; provide the valid directory path where 
				   the new cache root directory will be located.
